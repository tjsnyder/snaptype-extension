**Title:** I built a free text expander Chrome extension — SnapType

**Body:**
Hey everyone! I built SnapType, a Chrome extension that lets you save text snippets and expand them with shortcuts.

Type `/hello` + Tab and your full greeting appears instantly. It works on every website.

**Features:**
- Custom shortcuts that expand to any text
- Variables like {date}, {name}, {email}
- Command palette search (Cmd+Shift+Space)
- Right-click to save any selected text
- Usage stats to see how much time you save

Free with 10 snippets, Pro for unlimited at $4.99/mo.

I built this because I was tired of typing the same support responses and email intros over and over. Would love your feedback!

### r/Productivity

**Title:** I save 30+ minutes/week by not typing the same things twice

**Body:**
I kept catching myself typing the same email intros, support responses, and meeting follow-ups multiple times a day. So I built a Chrome extension to fix it.

The concept is simple:
1. Save a text snippet with a shortcut (like `/intro`)
2. Type the shortcut anywhere on the web
3. Press Tab — full text appears

It also supports variables, so `{date}` becomes today's date and `{name}` becomes whatever name you set.

After a week of use I tracked 200+ expansions and ~4,000 keystrokes saved. For anyone who writes a lot of emails or support messages, this is a game-changer.

Hi PH! I'm [name], and I built SnapType because I was spending way too much time typing the same emails and support responses.

The core idea is dead simple: save your commonly typed text, assign shortcuts, and let SnapType do the typing for you.

I'd love to hear your feedback — especially what snippets you'd use it for!
