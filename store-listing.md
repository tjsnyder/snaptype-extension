## Detailed Description

```
STOP TYPING THE SAME THINGS OVER AND OVER.

SnapType is a lightweight text expander that lives in your browser. Save text snippets with custom shortcuts, then expand them instantly on any website. Type a shortcut like /hello, press Tab, and watch your full message appear in a flash.

Whether you answer support tickets, write sales emails, review pull requests, or schedule interviews, SnapType eliminates repetitive typing so you can focus on the work that matters.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
HOW IT WORKS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. Create a snippet with a shortcut (e.g. /hello)
2. Type that shortcut in any text field on the web
3. Press Tab — your full text appears instantly

It really is that simple.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
KEY FEATURES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

▸ INSTANT TEXT EXPANSION
Type a short trigger like /thanks or /sig and press Tab. Your full snippet replaces the shortcut immediately — in Gmail, Slack, Zendesk, LinkedIn, Notion, or any website with a text field.

▸ SMART VARIABLES
Make your snippets dynamic with built-in variables that auto-fill when expanded:
  • {date} — today's date
  • {time} — current time
  • {day} — day of the week (Monday, Tuesday, etc.)
  • {month} — current month name
  • {year} — current year
  • {name} — your name (set in Settings)
  • {email} — your email address
  • {company} — your company name
  • {phone} — your phone number
  • {title} — your job title
  • {domain} — the current website domain
  • {cursor} — place your cursor exactly where you want it after expansion

▸ COMMAND PALETTE
Press Cmd+Shift+Space (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+Space (Windows/Linux) to open a searchable command palette overlay right on the page. Find and insert any snippet without leaving the text field you are working in. Navigate with arrow keys and press Enter to insert.

▸ FOLDER ORGANIZATION
Keep your snippet library tidy by organizing snippets into folders — Support Greetings, Billing Responses, Sales Outreach, Code Review, and whatever else fits your workflow. Folders are collapsible in the popup so you can focus on what you need.

▸ READY-MADE SNIPPET PACKS
Get productive in seconds with curated snippet collections you can import in one click:
  • Customer Support — 20 templates for greetings, troubleshooting, billing, and follow-ups
  • Sales Outreach — 10 templates for cold emails, follow-ups, objection handling, and closing
  • Developer Toolkit — 10 templates for PRs, commits, code reviews, standups, and incident reports
  • Recruiting & HR (Pro) — 20 templates for sourcing, scheduling, offers, and onboarding
  • E-commerce Support (Pro) — 20 templates for orders, shipping, returns, reviews, and cart recovery

▸ RIGHT-CLICK TO SAVE
See useful text on a webpage? Highlight it, right-click, and choose "Save as SnapType snippet" to instantly add it to your library.

▸ IMPORT & EXPORT
Back up your snippets or transfer them to another device by exporting to JSON. Import snippet files to quickly build your library.

▸ USAGE STATISTICS
Track how many times you have expanded snippets and how many keystrokes SnapType has saved you. The stats bar in the popup and the badge on the extension icon keep you motivated.

▸ CONFIGURABLE TRIGGER KEY
Choose the key that triggers expansion: Tab (default), Space, or Enter. Pick whatever feels natural for your typing style.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
USE CASES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

▸ CUSTOMER SUPPORT
Respond to tickets faster with pre-written greetings, troubleshooting steps, billing responses, escalation messages, and follow-ups. Use {name} to personalize every reply.

▸ SALES & BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT
Send personalized cold outreach, discovery questions, proposals, follow-ups, and closing messages in seconds. Spend more time selling, less time typing.

▸ SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS
Speed up code reviews, pull request descriptions, commit messages, standup updates, and incident reports. Keep your team communication consistent.

▸ RECRUITERS & HR
Source candidates, schedule interviews, send offer letters, and manage onboarding communications with professional templates ready to go.

▸ E-COMMERCE
Handle order confirmations, shipping updates, return processing, review requests, and cart abandonment recovery with consistent, professional messaging.

▸ ANYONE WHO TYPES REPETITIVELY
Email signatures, meeting agendas, frequently asked questions, common replies — if you type it more than once, SnapType should handle it.

## Store Screenshots (1280x800 or 640x400)

### Screenshot 1 -- Main Popup with Snippet List
**Filename:** `screenshot-1-popup.png`

Show the SnapType popup at full width, positioned over a blurred Gmail compose window. The popup should display:
- The header with the SnapType logo, Snippet Packs button, "+ New" button, and Settings gear icon
- The search bar at the top
- The stats bar reading something like "47 expansions - 1,284 keystrokes saved"
- A list of 5-6 snippets organized under two folders ("Default" and "Support - Greetings"), each showing the shortcut in an indigo pill (e.g., /hello, /thanks, /sig, /greet), a preview of the content, and a usage count
- The free plan banner at the bottom showing "Free plan: 5/10 snippets" with the Upgrade button

**Purpose:** Conveys the core UI at a glance. Users immediately understand the snippet list, search, and folder organization.

### Screenshot 2 -- Command Palette Overlay on a Webpage
**Filename:** `screenshot-2-command-palette.png`

Show a webpage (e.g., a Gmail compose window or Zendesk reply box) with the SnapType command palette floating in the center of the viewport. The overlay should display:
- A translucent dark backdrop behind the panel
- The search input with "Search snippets..." placeholder and the Esc key badge
- A filtered list of 4-5 snippets with the second one highlighted in the selected state (indigo background on the shortcut pill)
- Each row showing the shortcut, a text preview, and the folder tag
- The footer bar with keyboard hints: arrow keys to navigate, Enter to insert, Esc to close

**Purpose:** Shows the power-user workflow -- searching and inserting snippets without leaving the page.

### Screenshot 3 -- Text Expansion in Action
**Filename:** `screenshot-3-expansion.png`

Show a split or before/after composition:
- LEFT SIDE (or TOP): A text field with the cursor after typing `/meeting` and a subtle label "Type your shortcut..."
- RIGHT SIDE (or BOTTOM): The same text field now containing the fully expanded text: "Hi [name], Would you be available for a quick call on Monday? Let me know what time works for you. Best, Tim" with the small indigo "Expanded" toast floating above the field
- Include a visual arrow or transition indicator between the two states
- The background should be a realistic webpage like Gmail compose or a CRM reply field

**Purpose:** Demonstrates the core value proposition -- type a few characters, get a full message.

### Screenshot 4 -- Settings / Variables Configuration
**Filename:** `screenshot-4-settings.png`

Show the SnapType Settings (options) page in a clean browser tab. The page should display:
- The "SnapType Settings" heading with the subtitle "Configure your text expansion preferences"
- The General section with the "Enable text expansion" toggle (on) and the Trigger key dropdown set to "Tab"
- The Custom Variables section showing the variable grid with filled-in values: {name} = "Tim Snyder", {email} = "tim@example.com", {company} = "Acme Inc", {phone} = "555-0123", {title} = "Product Manager"
- The Data section with Export and Import buttons
- The "Save Settings" button at the bottom

**Purpose:** Shows customization depth and the custom variables feature that makes snippets personal.

### Screenshot 5 -- Snippet Packs Page
**Filename:** `screenshot-5-snippet-packs.png`

Show the Snippet Packs panel inside the popup. It should display:
- The dark header with "Snippet Packs" title and a back arrow
- The intro text "One-click import curated snippet collections for your workflow"
- 3-4 pack cards visible:
  - Customer Support (headphones icon, "FREE" green badge, "20 snippets", with an "Import" button)
  - Sales Outreach (chart icon, "FREE" green badge, "10 snippets", showing "Imported" state with a green checkmark)
  - Developer Toolkit (laptop icon, "FREE" green badge, "10 snippets", with an "Import" button)
  - Recruiting & HR (handshake icon, "PRO" indigo badge, "20 snippets", with "Unlock with Pro" button)
- A toast at the bottom showing "Imported 10 snippets!" partially faded

**Purpose:** Highlights the one-click snippet packs that help users get value immediately after install.

## Promotional Tiles

### Small Promotional Tile (440x280)
**Filename:** `promo-small-440x280.png`

Show the SnapType logo (lightning bolt icon) on the left with the tagline "Type less. Say more." on the right. Use a clean white or very light indigo (#f5f3ff) background. Include 2-3 floating snippet pill examples like `/hello`, `/thanks`, `/sig` in the indigo brand color (#6366f1) scattered subtly behind the text. Keep typography bold and minimal. Do not include any detailed UI screenshots at this size -- keep it focused on brand identity and the core message.

### Large Promotional Tile (920x680)
**Filename:** `promo-large-920x680.png`

Use a split layout. The left half shows a headline: "SnapType" in bold, the subheadline "Text Expander & Snippets" below it, and 3 short bullet points with checkmark icons: "Expand shortcuts instantly", "Smart variables & command palette", "Works on every website". The right half shows a realistic mockup of the SnapType popup overlaid on a blurred email compose window, angled slightly in a 3D perspective to add visual depth. Use the indigo-to-purple gradient (#6366f1 to #8b5cf6) as the background, with white text on the left. Include small floating shortcut pills (/hello, /thanks) around the mockup.

### Marquee Promotional Tile (1400x560)
**Filename:** `promo-marquee-1400x560.png`

Create a wide cinematic banner. The left third shows the SnapType branding: logo, name, and the tagline "Stop typing the same things over and over." The center shows a hero mockup of the command palette overlay on top of a realistic webpage, demonstrating the search-and-insert workflow. The right third shows 3 iconic use case labels with small icons: "Customer Support", "Sales Outreach", "Developer Tools". Use the brand gradient background (deep indigo #1e1b4b to indigo #6366f1), white text, and subtle diagonal light streaks or dot patterns for visual texture. The overall impression should be polished, professional, and SaaS-quality.

## Justification for Permissions

These justifications are written for the Chrome Web Store review team and should be entered in the "Permissions justification" fields during submission.

### `storage`

```
Stores user-created text snippets, expansion settings (trigger key, enabled state, theme), custom variable definitions (name, email, company), usage statistics (expansion count, keystrokes saved), license status, and imported snippet pack identifiers. All data is stored locally on the user's device using chrome.storage.local. No data is transmitted to external servers.
```

### `activeTab`

```
Required to inject expanded snippet text into the currently active tab when the user triggers a text expansion or inserts a snippet via the command palette. SnapType needs to interact with the focused text field (input, textarea, or contenteditable element) on the active page to replace the shortcut with the full snippet content. This permission is only used in response to direct user actions (typing a shortcut and pressing the trigger key, or selecting a snippet from the command palette).
```

### `contextMenus`

```
Provides a right-click context menu item labeled "Save as SnapType snippet" that appears when the user selects text on any webpage. This allows users to quickly save highlighted text as a new snippet without opening the popup. The menu item only appears in the "selection" context (when text is selected) and triggers a save to local storage.
```

### Content Scripts (`content_scripts` with `<all_urls>`)

```
SnapType requires content scripts on all URLs to provide its core text expansion functionality. The content script (content.js) listens for keyboard input in text fields to detect when the user types a snippet shortcut, then replaces the shortcut text with the expanded snippet. The overlay script (overlay.js) provides the command palette UI that appears when the user presses Cmd+Shift+Space / Ctrl+Shift+Space. Both scripts only activate in response to direct user actions (typing or keyboard shortcuts) and do not read, collect, or transmit any page content. No data leaves the user's device.
```

### Host Permissions (implicit via content scripts on `<all_urls>`)

```
Content scripts are declared with <all_urls> match pattern so that text expansion works on every website the user visits. SnapType's core value is expanding shortcuts in any text field on the web — Gmail, Slack, Zendesk, LinkedIn, CRMs, project management tools, and any other site where the user types. Restricting to specific URLs would break the product for the majority of use cases. The content scripts do not read page content or collect any data; they only interact with text fields in response to explicit user actions.
```
