## 3. First Comment (Maker Comment)

> Hi Product Hunt!
>
> I'm Tim, and I built SnapType because I was tired of typing the same emails, support replies, and meeting follow-ups dozens of times a day. I realized I was wasting 30-60 minutes every week on pure repetition -- writing the same greeting, the same sign-off, the same "thanks for reaching out" message over and over.
>
> So I built a Chrome extension to fix it.
>
> **How it works:** Save any text as a snippet, assign a shortcut like `/hello`, type it on any website, press Tab, and the full text appears instantly. That's the whole idea.
>
> **What makes SnapType different:**
>
> - **Free to start, no account required.** Install it and you're going in under 30 seconds. No sign-up, no email, no onboarding flow. Just start creating snippets.
> - **Works everywhere.** Gmail, Slack, LinkedIn, Notion, support desks, CRMs -- anywhere you type in Chrome.
> - **Tab trigger feels native.** It works like autocomplete you already know. Type the shortcut, hit Tab, done.
> - **100% client-side.** Your data stays on your machine. Nothing goes to a server. Works offline.
>
> **Free tier includes:**
> - 10 snippets (enough for most people to get real value)
> - Smart variables like {date}, {name}, {email}
> - Folders to organize your snippets
> - Command palette search (Cmd+Shift+Space)
> - Right-click to save any selected text as a snippet
> - Usage stats so you can see the time you're saving
>
> If you need more, **SnapType Pro** is $4.99/mo for unlimited snippets, custom variables, import/export, and priority support.
>
> I'd genuinely love your feedback -- what would you use it for? What snippets would you create first? And if anything feels off or broken, let me know. I'm building this solo and every bit of input helps.
>
> Thanks for checking it out!

- **Key elements:** Snippet list with shortcut labels visible, folder groupings, the stats bar showing "247 expansions / 12,400 keystrokes saved", the "+ New" button
- **Background:** Place the popup over a blurred Gmail or Slack window to show context

### Screenshot 3: Variables in Action
- **What to show:** A snippet being expanded that includes {name}, {date}, and {company} variables, with the resolved values shown in the output
- **Dimensions:** 1270x760px
- **Key elements:** The raw snippet template on the left with variable syntax highlighted in purple, the expanded result on the right with real values filled in, a connecting arrow or "becomes" indicator
- **Background:** Show this happening inside a real-looking email compose window

### Screenshot 4: Command Palette / Search
- **What to show:** The command palette overlay open on a webpage, search query typed, matching snippets listed below
- **Dimensions:** 1270x760px
- **Key elements:** The search overlay in the center of the screen (similar to Spotlight or VS Code command palette), a few search results with shortcut names and preview text, keyboard shortcut badge showing Cmd+Shift+Space
- **Background:** A slightly dimmed webpage behind the palette to show it works as an overlay

### Screenshot 5: Free vs. Pro Comparison
- **What to show:** A clean comparison card showing what's included in Free (10 snippets, variables, folders, search, stats) vs. Pro ($4.99/mo -- unlimited snippets, custom variables, import/export, priority support)
- **Dimensions:** 1270x760px
- **Key elements:** Two columns, Free highlighted as generous, Pro highlighted as the upgrade path, checkmarks for included features, the price prominently displayed
- **Background:** Brand gradient, polished marketing-style layout (not a screenshot of the app)

### General screenshot tips:
- Use a tool like Figma, Canva, or CleanShot X to create polished frames
- Add a 1-2 line caption to each image (Product Hunt supports gallery captions)
- Keep text large enough to read at thumbnail size
- Use the SnapType purple (#6366f1) as the accent color throughout

- **Avoid launching alongside major tech announcements** (Apple events, Google I/O, etc.)

## 8. Social Media Templates

### Template 1: Launch Announcement (Twitter/X)

```
I just launched SnapType on Product Hunt!

It's a free Chrome extension that expands text shortcuts instantly.

Type /hello + Tab and your full greeting appears -- on any website.

I was typing the same emails 20x/day. Now I don't.

Would love your support:
[Product Hunt link]
```

### Template 2: Feature Highlight (Twitter/X)

```
SnapType is live on Product Hunt today.

Here's what it does:

- Save text snippets with shortcuts (/thanks, /sig, /intro)
- Type the shortcut anywhere in Chrome
- Press Tab -- full text appears instantly
- Free. No account needed. Works offline.

Smart variables like {date} and {name} make every snippet dynamic.

Check it out: [Product Hunt link]
```

### Template 3: Personal Story (Twitter/X or LinkedIn)

```
I spent months typing the same support replies, email intros, and meeting follow-ups. Over and over. Every single day.

So I built SnapType -- a Chrome extension that replaces repetitive typing with instant shortcuts.

Today it's live on Product Hunt.

The free tier gives you 10 snippets, smart variables, folders, and a command palette search. No account, no sign-up, works offline.

If you type the same things more than twice, this will save you real time.

I'd love your feedback: [Product Hunt link]
```

### LinkedIn adaptation note:
For LinkedIn, expand the personal story angle. Lead with the problem (repetitive typing), mention the time cost (30-60 min/week), then introduce SnapType as the solution. LinkedIn audiences respond well to "I built this to solve my own problem" framing.

## 9. Promotional Offers for Product Hunt Users

### Offer A: Extended Free Tier (Recommended)
- **What:** Product Hunt users get **25 free snippets** instead of 10 (permanent upgrade)
- **How:** Create a special activation code (e.g., `PRODUCTHUNT`) that users enter in the extension settings to unlock the bonus
- **Why it works:** Low cost to you, high perceived value, creates goodwill, and gets users more invested before they hit a limit
- **Mention in:** Maker comment and PH description

### Offer B: Launch Week Discount
- **What:** **50% off the first 3 months of Pro** ($2.49/mo instead of $4.99/mo) -- only available during launch week
- **How:** Create a Lemon Squeezy coupon code (e.g., `PHLAUNCH50`) with a 7-day expiration
- **Why it works:** Urgency drives conversions, the discounted price feels like a no-brainer, and after 3 months users are hooked on unlimited snippets
- **Mention in:** Maker comment as a "thank you to the PH community"

### Offer C: Lifetime Deal (if you want a bigger splash)
- **What:** **$29.99 one-time payment for lifetime Pro access** -- limited to the first 100 buyers
- **How:** Create a separate Lemon Squeezy product with a capped quantity
- **Why it works:** Lifetime deals are extremely popular on PH, drive high upfront revenue, and generate buzz. The scarcity of 100 units creates urgency. At $29.99, it pays for itself vs. the subscription in 6 months.
- **Risk:** You cap future recurring revenue from these users. Only offer if you want a strong launch spike.
- **Mention in:** Maker comment, description, and a dedicated callout in the PH gallery images

### Offer D: Free Ultimate Snippet Collection
- **What:** All PH upvoters get the **Ultimate Snippet Collection** (200+ templates, normally $9.99) for free
- **How:** Provide a unique download link or coupon code in a follow-up comment once the launch is live
- **Why it works:** Adds tangible value, showcases the snippet ecosystem, and encourages people to install the extension to use the templates
- **Mention in:** As a "surprise bonus" a few hours into the launch day to create a second wave of interest

### Recommended combination:
Use **Offer A** (extended free tier) as the default for all PH users, and **Offer B** (50% off Pro) as the upgrade incentive. This gives everyone a reason to install and power users a reason to convert. Add **Offer D** (free snippet collection) as a bonus reveal mid-day to boost engagement.
